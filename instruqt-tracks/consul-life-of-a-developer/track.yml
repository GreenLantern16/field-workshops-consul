    You can see the complete guide on Kubernetes multi-cluster federation here: https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/installation/multi-cluster/kubernetes <br>

    Start deploying to the stateless cluster with Helm. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    helm install -f /root/helm/k8s1-consul-values.yaml hashicorp hashicorp/consul  --wait --debug
    ```

    Check the pods. <br>

    ```
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    Check the Consul API. You can also see the Consul UI is now up. <br>

    ```
    curl localhost:8500/v1/status/leader
    ```

    In the next assignment you will federate with the other K8s clusters.

  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will finish the steps in this guide for the secondary cluster: https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/installation/multi-cluster/kubernetes <br>

    First, create the federation secret. The helm chart created this for you on the primary cluster. Use the below command to extract it.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl get secret hashicorp-consul-federation -o yaml > consul-federation-secret.yaml
    ```

    Switch the second k8s cluster.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl apply -f consul-federation-secret.yaml
    ```

    Deploy Consul to k8s2 cluster.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    helm install -f /root/helm/k8s2-consul-values.yaml hashicorp hashicorp/consul  --wait --debug
    ```

    Check that the Kubernetes clusters are now federated.

    ```
    consul members -wan
    ```

    In this new few assignments, you will deploy workloads to these clusters.

  assignment: |
    In this assignment you will deploy the stateful storage of your application to the K8s2 cluster. <br>

    Start by applying the proxy defaults to the cluster. You will use this configuration later for the observability assignments. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl apply -f config/proxy-defaults.yml
    ```

    Now deploy the stateful storage components.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl apply -f storage
    ```

  assignment: |
    In this assignment you will deploy the stateless components of your application to the K8s1 cluster.
    You will deploy the `v3` version of this application. <br>


    Now deploy the frontend, public API, and product API components.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl apply -f v3
    ```

    In the next assignment we will connect these components to the storage tier in the other K8s cluster.

  assignment: |-
    Your application should now be available.  We can quickly test the APIs by exposing the public API as a NodePort services.
    NodePort services are uncommon in production, but suitable for dev and test. <br>

    Expose the public API service.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl expose deployment public-api --type=NodePort --name=public-api-service
    ```

    Fetch the details of the service you just created.

    ```
    kubectl describe svc public-api-service
    port=$(kubectl get svc public-api-service -o json | jq '.spec.ports[0].nodePort')
    ```

    Try the API <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://k8s1:${port}/api \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
    -H 'DNT: 1' \
    --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  coffees{id,name,price}\n}"}' \
    --compressed | jq
    ```

    You should have received a 200 status code from the app with the coffees in stock. <br>

    In the next few assignments you will be introduced to more advanced traffic management patterns.

    Review and apply the ingress config.

    ```

    In the next assignment you will configure request routing for this ingress gateway.
