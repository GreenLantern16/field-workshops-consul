    The cloud infrastructure team has already set up cloud infrastructure for this environment.
    You can think of workstation terminal as your developer machine preloaded with cloud access credentials. <br>

    Any any time you can use the AWS console to view your environment.
    AWS CLI commands will be provided for you to interact with AWS's APIs. <br>


    View the VPCs in your environment.

    ```
    aws ec2  describe-vpcs --region us-east-1
    ```

    You'll notice you have four separate VPCs that map to the infra diagram shared earlier.
    Their CIDR blocks are listed below.

    ```
    terraform-vpc-shared-svcs: 10.1.0.0/16
    terraform-vpc-frontend: 10.2.0.0/16
    terraform-vpc-api: 10.3.0.0/16
    terraform-vpc-storage: 10.4.0.0/16
    ```
