  title: Use Consul to find the IP address of the database server
  teaser: Where's the database server?
  assignment: |
    The website is DOWN! Your application server is not working correctly. You've determined that the app can't connect to the database.

    Edit the `wp-config.php` file in the App Config tab. On line 32 you'll find the configuration for the database server.

    Use the Consul UI to find the database server's IP and put it into the config file. Then on the App Server tab you can restart the application like so:

    ```
    service apache2 restart
    ```

    Verify that the application setup page is loading in the Website tab.
