Remember those ever complex networking scenarios? Consul can help us bridge our multi-cloud service networking platforms by connecting and securing them.

Consul for Service Discovery
-------------------------

Stop managing network configuration files and hard-coded IP addresses. Consul has a full service catalog containing up-to-date location and health status for all your services. You can easily find and access healthy instances of a service using DNS queries or an HTTP API.

Load Balancing Made Simple
-------------------------
Sometimes all you need is simple round-robin load balancing. Consul has got you covered. Why pay huge amounts of money for that expensive load balancer just to route traffic to your internal employee portal?

Load balancers are:
* Expensive
* Hard to maintain
* Load grows as you scale
* Requires health probes for every backend system

---
name: Configuration-Management-with-Consul
Configuration Management
-------------------------
Manage config files using Consul Template. This enables several beneficial outcomes:

* Automatically keep legacy config files up to date
* Store configuration data in Consul's key/value store
* Do blue/green or canary deployments

Data Center Failover with Prepared Queries
-------------------------
Consul prepared queries allow you to build logic into your DNS based service catalog. This enables transparent failover when the primary datacenter becomes unavailable.

```json
{
  "Name": "banking-app",
  "Service": {
    "Service": "banking-app",
    "Tags": ["v1.2.3"],
    "Failover": {
      "Datacenters": ["dc2", "dc3"]
    }
  }
}
```

Consul Connect - a Modern Service Mesh
-------------------------

Take your applications into the future while remaining compatible with legacy systems. Consul Connect is a multi-cloud friendly service mesh that can safely and automatically connect services and applications from anywhere on your network. 

This greatly reduces the amount of complexity needed to route traffic securely between endpoints.
