.center[Physical servers, to VMs, to containers...]

As our applications have shifted from monoliths to microservices, the networking landscape has changed drastically. Let's briefly explore the history  of this shift, and how Consul can help us with its  challenges.

name: Client-Server
Introduction of Client & Server
-------------------------
<img align="right" width="70%" src="images/client_server_flow.png">

<br><br>
* Single application per Server
* No app mobility
* Security mapped to IP
* Seldom horizontal scale of an app
* High trust zones and perimeter

name: Introduction-of-VMs
Introduction of the VM
-------------------------
<img align="right" width="70%" src="images/vm_flow.png">

<br><br>
* Better HW utilization
* Basic networking in Hypervisor
* VM mobility
* Some Horizontal scaling
* Load balancers
* Spanning trees

Introduction of the Fabric
-------------------------
<img align="right" width="70%" src="images/fabric_flow.png">

<br><br>
* L2 Fabrics
* Mostly proprietary L2 routing
* More single service instances
* More Load Balancers
* Spine & Leaf

name: Introduction-of-the-Microservice
Introduction of the Microservice
-------------------------
<img align="right" width="70%" src="images/microservices.png">

<br><br>
* Highly maintainable and testable
* Loosely coupled
* Independently deployable
* Organized around business capabilities
* Owned by a small team
