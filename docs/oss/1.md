Introduction of Client & Server
-------------------------

.center[Monolithic request, response]

* Single application per Server
* No app mobility
* Security mapped to IP
* Seldom horizontal scale of an app
* High trust zones and perimeter

* Better HW utilization
* Basic networking in Hypervisor
* VM mobility
* Some Horizontal scaling
* Load balancers
* Spanning trees

As you can see our networking model have drastically changed.
Let's learn a little more about how Consul works, and then we can revisit these challenges with Consul.
