  assignment: |
    Welcome to Consul Basics! In this lab you'll start up a three-node Consul cluster. Once all three nodes have joined the server cluster you should see the Consul UI become healthy.

    Start the Consul server process on each cluster node with the following command. You can simply copy and paste it into the terminal for each server.
    ```
    start_consul.sh
    ```
